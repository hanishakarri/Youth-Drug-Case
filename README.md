README

This repository contains the code and data related to a project investigating factors affecting youth drug and smoking behavior. The project report is available in the file "Youth-drugcase.docx", providing an overview of the study, its objectives, and findings.

Code:
The file "YouthParse.Rmd" contains the complete code used for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. You can refer to this file to understand the steps taken during the study and reproduce the results if desired.

Data:
To perform the analysis, we utilized the "NSDUH_2020.Rdata.zip" file, which contains the data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health for the year 2020. This dataset focuses on individuals below 18 years of age and includes carefully chosen variables for our study.

Please note that the "NSDUH_2020.Rdata.zip" file needs to be extracted before use. You can unzip it to access the actual data file.

File Size Limitations:
GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB for individual files. In case you encounter files larger than this limit, such as "Youth-drugcase.docx" or the unzipped data file, please consider the alternative approaches mentioned in the previous response for handling large files, such as using Git LFS or external storage.
